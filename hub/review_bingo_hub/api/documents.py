"""Document upload and download endpoints with object storage.

This module provides API endpoints for uploading and downloading documents
using object storage (local filesystem, Azure Blob, AWS S3, or GCS).

Files are stored in object storage rather than the database, providing:
- Scalability: Files don't bloat the database
- Performance: Faster queries without large binary data
- Cost efficiency: Object storage is cheaper than database storage

Security Note:
    All document endpoints enforce tenant isolation via TenantDep.
    Documents are scoped to organization_id and users can only access
    documents belonging to their organization.

Architecture:
    1. Upload endpoint receives file via multipart/form-data
    2. File is uploaded to object storage via StorageService
    3. Document metadata (filename, size, storage_path, storage_url) saved to DB
    4. Download endpoint retrieves file from object storage and streams to client

For cloud providers (Azure/S3/GCS), the download endpoint returns a redirect
to a presigned URL for direct download, reducing load on the application server.
