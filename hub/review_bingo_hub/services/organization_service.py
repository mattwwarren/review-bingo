"""Organization data access helpers for services and endpoints.

Security Note:
    Organization operations are inherently tenant-isolated since organizations
    ARE the tenant boundary. However, operations must still verify that:
    - get_organization: User has membership in requested org
    - list_organizations: Only returns orgs the user is a member of
    - update_organization: User has membership in org being updated
    - delete_organization: User has membership (and appropriate role) in org
