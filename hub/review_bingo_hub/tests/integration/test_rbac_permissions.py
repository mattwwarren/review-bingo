"""Comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) tests.

Tests verify that role-based permissions prevent unauthorized actions within
organizations. These tests ensure:

1. OWNER can perform all operations (delete org, change roles, manage members)
2. ADMIN can manage members and settings but not delete org or change roles
3. MEMBER can only use resources, not manage them
4. Role hierarchy is enforced (OWNER > ADMIN > MEMBER)
5. Users cannot escalate their own roles
